  In collaboration with the Visual Snow Initiative, this project tries to solve
  a pressing problem for users across many regions of the world. The exercises
  used by this method are videos of many gigabites each, which in locations
  where connection coverage is scarce, is a big issue for the users experience.
  In this new approach we tried to solve the problem, shrinking the size of the
  videos by remaking them in a Virtual Reality space.

  Users can now access all the video by loading this light and fast website
  instead of downloading many Gigabites of files. We hope that many will have an
  easier time, and that this can help grow research and awaresess.
